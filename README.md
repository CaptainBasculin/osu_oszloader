# osu_oszloader
A basic script I use for autoloading in .osz files downloaded to osu!.

# Usage

Input your osu songs folder and downloads folder in their specific locations.

After that, you can launch it. It will carry the osz files to the songs folder
at which, the osu app can load it in with a beatmap list refresh.

I made this because it felt like a hassle to open each osz file.

Use this code at whatever you want.
