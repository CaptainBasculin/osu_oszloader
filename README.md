# osu_oszloader
A basic script I use for autoloading in .osz files downloaded to osu!.

# Usage

Download osuimport.py

Edit it with a text editor. Input your osu songs folder and downloads folder in their specific locations.

After that, you can launch it via python3 (through command line: python3 osuimport.py) It will carry the osz files to the songs folder
at which, the osu app can load it in with a beatmap list refresh.

There's a commented out section that makes it work with browsers that write data to the file as it downloads. Active section works for downloading via Firefox/Chrome

I made this because it felt like a hassle to open each osz file.

Use this code at whatever you want. I permit it
